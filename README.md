# SQL---PORTFOLIO-Project
This project demonstrates extensive SQL techniques for cleaning and transforming raw layoffs data. Key steps include removing duplicates, standardizing inconsistent entries, handling missing values, and formatting dates. It ensures a clean, consistent dataset ready for analysis, showcasing strong SQL skills for data professionals.
This project is a comprehensive SQL data cleaning and transformation workflow focused on preparing raw layoffs data for effective analysis. 
It starts by creating a staging table to work on a copy of the original dataset, preserving data integrity. 
The process includes identifying and removing duplicate records using SQL window functions to ensure data uniqueness.
It also standardizes inconsistent categorical data, such as industry names and country fields, for uniformity. Missing and null values are carefully handled, with some fields updated based on related information to enhance data completeness.
Date and text fields are normalized to consistent formats, and unnecessary columns and rows are removed to streamline the dataset. 
This project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques for data quality improvement, providing a clear and structured approach to complex data cleaning that prepares datasets for accurate reporting and analysis.
The detailed documentation makes it easy to understand and replicate, supporting skill development in data manipulation and transformation.
